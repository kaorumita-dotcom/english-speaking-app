Debug analysis:
- Error: "Failed to start recording: TypeError: Cannot read property 'getUserMedia' of undefined"
- Source: recording.tsx line 136:7 → recorder.prepareToRecordAsync()
- The error comes from AudioModule.web.js createMediaRecorder() which calls getUserMedia()
- The dev server runs with --web flag, so Metro bundles the web version of expo-audio
- Expo Go on device connects to this Metro server and gets the web bundle
- Problem: The app is being served as a web bundle, not native

Key insight: The dev server is started with `--web` flag which means it serves web bundles.
When Expo Go connects, it should get native bundles via Metro, not web bundles.
But the error trace shows AudioModule.web.js is being loaded.

This is likely because Expo Go is loading the app through a web browser (Chrome custom tab)
rather than through the native Expo Go runtime.

Solution: The recording must work in BOTH web and native contexts.
For web: Use navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia with proper error handling
For native: Use expo-audio native APIs

Need to detect platform and handle accordingly, with proper fallback for web environments
where mediaDevices may not be available (like Expo Go's embedded browser).
